title: "Of the Canonical Books of the Old and New Testaments"
text: >
    We believe that the Holy Scriptures are contained in two books, namely, the
    Old and New Testament, which are canonical, against which nothing can be
    alleged. These are thus named in the Church of God.

    The books of the Old Testament are the five books of Moses, to wit: Genesis,
    Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; the book of Joshua, Judges,
    Ruth, the two books of Samuel, the two of the Kings, two books of the
    Chronicles, commonly called Paralipomenon, the first of Ezra, Nehimiah,
    Esther, Job, the Psalms of David, the three books of Solomon, namely, the
    Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs; the four great prophets,
    Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel; and the twelve lesser prophets,
    namely, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk,
    Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.

    Those of the New Testament are the four evangelists, to wit: Matthew, Mark,
    Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles; the fourteen epistles of the apostle
    Paul, namely, one to the Romans, two to the Corinthians, one to the 
    Galatians, one to the Ephesians, one to the Philippians, one to the
    Colossians, two to the Thessalonians, two to Timothy, one to Tius, one to
    Philemon, and one to the Hebrews; the seven epistles of the other apostles,
    namely, one of James, two of Peter, three of John, one of Jude; and the
    Revelation of the apostle John.
