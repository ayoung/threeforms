    We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will of
    man, but that men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit, as the apostle
    Peter says; and that afterwards God, from a special care which He
    has for us and our salvation, commanded His servants, the prophets and
    apostles, to commit His revealed word to writing; and He Himself wrote
    with His own finger the two tables of the law. Therefore we call such
    writings holy and divine Scriptures.
