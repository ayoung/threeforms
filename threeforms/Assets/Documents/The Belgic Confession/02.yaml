	We know Him by two means: First, by the creation, preservation, and
	government of the universe; which is before our eyes as a most elegant
	book, wherein all creatures, great and small, are as so many characters
	leading us to see clearly the invisible things of God, even his everlasting
	power and divinity, as the apostle Paul says (Rom. 1:20). All which things
	are sufficient to convince men and leave them without excuse. Second, He
	makes Himself more clearly and fully known to us by His holy and divine
	Word, that is to say, as far as is necessary for us to know in this life, to His
	glory and our salvation.
